  description: This site bundles a store front (links off to a 3rd party store), training
    sections, video galleries, profiles, and blogs. All the content is managed by
    the user via easy to use edit buttons throughout the site. The design was prepared
    by another designer and moved from a Photoshop PSD to CSS/jQuery theme in Drupal.
