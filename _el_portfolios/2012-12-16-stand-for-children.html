  description: One of my favorite projects is <a href="http://stand.org">Stand.org</a>,
    as the site pushed myself and my whole team forward, and we ended up making one
    of the strongest platforms for getting their message out. Taking on all the Front
    End Web Development and making sure it all integrated into the Drupal Theme was
    my task. A unique challenge for the project was the styling of the different blocks
    of the site. The CMS allows the client to create and move around blocks with multiple
    fields of text, images, videos, and buttons with each of the presence or absence
    of those elements rendering a different looking block. Additionally they all can
    be designated as one of three different widths. This project was created at <a
    href="http://ombuweb.com">OMBU Web</a> with the tireless effort of <a href="http://twitter.com/duellj">Jon
    Duell</a> behind the Back End Drupal Development, and <a href="http://twitter.com/axolx">Martin
    Rio</a> handling the project’s management and execution. The design was provided
    by a partner agency providing many static Photoshop documents which I turned into
    the Drupal Theme.
