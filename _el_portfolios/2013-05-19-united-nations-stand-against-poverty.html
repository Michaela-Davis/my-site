    Against Poverty</a>, for the United Nations <a class=\"ext\" href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Millennium Development Goals Campaign</a>, which hosts the world
    wide event. The website hosted nearly 4,000 events which were created on the site
    from users that signed up all over the world. The web site allowed them to download
    materials, announce there event, and report the total numbers of participants
    that attended. Afterwards, we created the biggest Microsoft Excel sheet you've
    ever seen of event titles, locations, emails, and participants of all the events
    all over the world to hand off to the Millennium Development Goals counting team,
    who verified the events and the number of participants. This was submitted to
    the Guinness Book of World Records which gave them the record for the \"<a class=\"ext\"
    href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/adjudications/081009_Largest_stand_up.aspx\"
    target=\"_blank\">Largest Stand Up in One Week</a>\" for the <strong>173,045,325
    participants</strong> that our website counted. The numbers were <a class=\"ext\"
    href=\"http://standagainstpoverty.org/content/guinness-world-record-shattered-citizens-across-globe-demanding-their-leaders-end-poverty\"
    target=\"_blank\">announced here</a>.\r\n\r\nThe Drupal site had 26,359 nodes,
    or pieces of content, 3,664 users, visitors from 199 countries, and 298,922 pageviews
    this month. In addition, the site allowed uploaded videos attached to the users
    event get sent to <a class=\"ext\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/mcampaign\" target=\"_blank\">their
    YouTube channel</a> and photos to there <a class=\"ext\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/standagainstpoverty/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Flickr photostream</a>, which created an enormous amount of
    user generated content uploaded to these social media services. Easily our biggest
    and most successful project."
