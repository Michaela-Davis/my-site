<h2>Website Design &amp; Theme Development</h2>

<p>I implement an iterative approach to developing a web site design. I want to mold this site with the involvement and influence of the client through defining our goals, designing &amp; building it, then reviewing the result and reiterating on it by going through another define, design, &amp; build cycle.
<h3>CMS Integration</h3>
Making sure your site stays up to date is important, and there's no better way to easily update your site than by having it built on top of a Content Management System (CMS). No technical knowledge necessary.
<h4>Simple &amp; Easy: Perch CMS</h4>
If a basic site needs to have some basic editable pages &amp; sections, then <a href="http://grabaperch.com/">Perch</a> as a simple, quick, and easy Content Management System is perfect.
<h4>Blogging &amp; a Little More Power: Wordpress</h4>
Balancing ease of use &amp; plenty of features, <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, is the engine behind many of the blogs on the Internet. Through it's vast amount of plugins and extensibility, it's not just limited to blogs, but can power the editing behind many other pages on the site.
<h4>The Customizable Powerhouse: Drupal</h4>
One of the most powerful and customizable Content Management Systems on the Internet is <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>. Powering big sites like <a href="http://whitehouse.gov">The White House</a>, <a href="http://buytaert.net/twitter-using-drupal">Twitter's Developer's Site</a>, <a href="http://buytaert.net/ikea-using-drupal">IKEA</a>, <a href="http://www.louvre.fr/">The Lourve</a>, <a href="http://buytaert.net/best-buy-using-drupal">Best Buy Mobile</a>, <a href="http://paramount.com">Paramount Pictures</a>, and a <a href="http://buytaert.net/tag/drupal-sites">whole host of other sites</a>. It is highly customizable and can be adapted to suit hundreds of situations.</p>

<p>I am a seasoned Drupal Themer and would make a great addition to any team needing help with the front end of a Drupal theme or needed designs turned in to a Drupal Theme.</p>
