<p>This is a continually updated list of what I'm currently using.</p>

<h2>Workspace</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.evanlovely.com/tricky-name/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/1362295702.jpg" title="My Workspace" alt="A standing desk in front of a window" class="alignright size-full" width="449" height="600" /></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050S7CK8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0050S7CK8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=evalov-20">Cheap minimal standing desk</a> from IKEA.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB5KA8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001FB5KA8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=evalov-20">Stool</a> for when standing gets old.</li>
<li><a href="http://loveatfirstsit.com/">Nada Chair</a> for correct lumber alignment while on said stool — better back support than <strong>any</strong> chair I've used.</li>
<li>West facing window that overlooks a nice scene and allows me to focus far away and not close at my computer all the time. Bonus: sunny afternoons soak me in sun and leave my monitors glare-free. <em>Love</em> those days.</li>
<li>Sunlamp for keeping energy high when said sun is not around.</li>
<li>Awesome <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/footfun/3838719190/">cat</a> that thinks he's cooler than my keyboard.</li>
<li>Yerba Maté for caffeine (but I still love coffee). <a href="http://www.evanlovely.com/personal/why-i-love-yerba-mate-and-its-benefits/">Here's why I love it.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<ul>
<li>13" Retina MacBook Pro - <em>love</em> the pixel density: displays as much as a 20" monitor.</li>
<li>23" Cinema Display - had this since 2004 and love it.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://amzn.to/ZBE3pA">Laptop Stand</a>, an Apple Bluetooth Keyboard, &amp; a Magic Trackpad - needed to get the laptop's display up in height so I didn't hunch to look at it. Back pain sucks. Used to be anti-external keyboard as I loved having my thumbs rest on the trackpad &amp; fingers on the keyboard but whatever; the Magic Trackpad is epic and I love how I can position it so my wrist is always straight.</li>
<li>Time Machine drive that backs up laptop &amp; a portable USB3 hard drive that holds all photos. I have another Time Machine hard drive off site that gets updated with the photos hard drive &amp; laptop about once a week or so. If my house got broken into and all computers &amp; hard drives got stolen, I'd lose no data; I'm mainly concerned about my 60,000 photos I've taken over the past 13 years. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>Oh boy, this could be a lot; however being a Front End Web Developer is my trade and these are my tools. Here we go.</p>

<h3>Using a Mac Without These Apps Just Feels Wrong</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> - The ultimate productivity utility. I used to be a big <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a> fan, but have recently crossed over to the Alfred camp. I can already see the benefits. I highly suggest people moving from using Spotlight as an application launcher to using one of these amazing swiss-army utilities. Version 2's workflow are out of this world.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.evanlovely.com/technology/improving-custom-home-row-arrow-keys-mac-hyper/">Moving the arrow keys to the home row</a> - Holy crap what a time saver; just like using keyboard shortcuts saves you time by not moving your hand off the home row, having your arrow keys in a place that doesn't require you to move your hands off the home row saves you <strong>so</strong> much time.</li>
<li><a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/">TotalFinder</a> - Gives Finder tabs, why the hell are they not there now? Tabs are <em>everywhere</em>, hell: IE7 has tabs! </li>
<li><a href="http://mizage.com/divvy/">Divvy</a> - Effortless window management</li>
<li><a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/">Flux</a> - Save your eyesight at night by tinting your monitor at sunset. Helps you sleep better too; seriously.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Without These Apps, I'd Be an Organizational Mess</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> - I have a love/hate relationship with this application: I love it because my life would be a mess without knowing what I need to do and I hate it because it reminds me of how much stuff I need to do. I am a self-admitted app junky and I have tried all the to do apps, and this is hands down the best one. Learning it takes a lit bit more work than your average app, but the return is far greater, and OmniFocus 2 for the Mac looks to of improved the usability hurtles that the initial version had. I love the syncing with my iPhone app which is robust and powerful as well. For those that are curious: I had my start with OmniOutliner + Kinkless to handle tasks before OmniFocus.</li>
<li><a href="http://db.tt/50dRrVC">Dropbox</a> - Truly safe storage &amp; syncing of files. We rely on it's multi-user file sharing heavily for our location-distributed web development work at OMBU Web and with other clients, and it provides versioned backups <em>every time you save a file</em>. Also, I keep a lot of plain text files in Markdown format for my notes on projects or anything else that is frequently referenced and edited heavily and bounce between <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvAlt</a>, <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a>, and <a href="http://multimarkdown.com/">MultiMarkdown Composer</a> for editing, and  for just about everything else it heads to the next item.</li>
<li><a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> - If it makes it into Evernote, I <strong>know</strong> it'll be safe and more importantly: that I can find it within two minutes. I've been using Evernote since April 17, 2008 (got in during private beta) and currently have 3,472 notes; and I can find anything that's in there in about two minutes, even from my phone. And since I can add to it from my phone, it gives me a super important thing: ubiquitous capture and retrieval i.e. I can add to it and get stuff from it and anyplace and anytime (yea, there are a few exceptions, but it's a lot of places!). And that means I trust it! </li>
<li><a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> - There are a few things that don't make it into Evernote or Dropbox: passwords, credit card numbers, and other things that belong in a digital safe. The app is <a href="http://help.agilebits.com/1Password3/security.html">super secure</a> too. </li>
<li>Calendar - I subscribe to GTD's approach to calendaring: it is the immovable landscape. However I have other calendars as well for optional events: Fun for anytime I see a concert flyer or cool thing to do, and I set a two day heads-up alarm so I can act on going with enough time to plan. My favorite way to interact with my calendar is easily <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>; I love that it's  always up in my menu bar and putting events into it is not only easy but a joy. That's right: I just said that it can make calendaring a joy, therefore the app must be awesome :)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Front End Web Development Apps</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> - The code editor of my dreams and so incredibly powerful. All the "GoTo" functionality makes it feels like the editor is an extension of your brain. I'll be giving a presentation at the Portland Front End Drupal Users Group this week actually! It'll include this app and a few of my favorite packages:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.emmet.io/">Emmet</a> - rapid CSS &amp; HTML expansion</li>
<li>Git - Commit, push, pull &amp; more quickly from within Sublime Text</li>
<li>Sidebar Enhancements - Should really be baked into the core app functionality</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> - Great visual version control app for Git, Mercurial, and Subversion.</li>
<li><a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope">Xscope</a> - My indispensable digital ruler; I particular love the "Loupe".</li>
<li><a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> - Slick code assistant for all your SASS &amp; LESS CSS processing needs. Web Development feels wrong without live reload as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html">Google Chrome Canary</a> - It blows me away how much you can do in the Web Inspector now, keep the latest improvements coming your way. <a href="http://paulirish.com/2012/chrome-canary-for-developers/">Here's why you should use Chrome Canary over Chrome</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> - A true <em>web</em> design application. At least as close as we're getting right now...</li>
<li>Photoshop - Only because I have to. More and more I'm seeing this great application that was made for editing photos (hence the name: <em>Photo</em>Shop) and using it to design the movable web. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">SequelPro</a> - Makes MySQL Database management easy.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.screenfloatapp.com/">ScreenFloat</a> - Floatable screenshots. Great for grabbing just a slice of a comp and pulling it with you. Great for those times that screen real estate is a concern. Bonus: if you scroll down while hovering over them you can make them transparent and use them for pixel perfecting web work. Love this app.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fuelcollective.com/eon">Eon</a> - Awesome time tracking that integrates with tons of sites. </li>
<li><a href="http://kapeli.com/">Dash</a> - Quick reference to documentation for tons of stuff, here's what I have: HTML, CSS, Drupal, Wordpress, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS, Compass, jQuery, Javascript, &amp; PHP.</li>
<li><a href="http://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a> &amp; <a href="http://pngmini.com/">ImageAlpha</a> - Fabulous image compression</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pixa-app.com/">Pixa</a> - Stock Images &amp; Vector organization. This app is so sweet I almost want to write a blog post about just it. Can scan an external folder, uses OpenMeta (native) tags, can search by color… it's just sweet.</li>
<li><a href="http://evernote.com/skitch/">Skitch</a> - Screenshots with arrows and text just explains things <em>so</em> much better. They've also fixed a lot of things that people didn't like about the 2.0 update.</li>
<li><a href="http://krillapps.com/patterns/">Patterns</a> - <strong>Finally</strong> allowed me to understand Regular Expressions.</li>
<li><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a> - Code Snippet &amp; frequently used text management. I used to use and love [CodeBox], but it seems to of dropped off in active development and I'm seeing more features I like with TextExpander.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Photo Management</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a> - iPhoto Pro basically.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.panoedit.com/">PanoEdit</a> - Panorama merging. Used to use Photoshop's Auto-Align &amp; Auto-Blend.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.placetaggerapp.com/">PlaceTagger</a> - Geotag your SLR photos by having your iPhone track your GPS route.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Helpful Utilities</h3>

<li><a href="https://droplr.com/hello">Droplr</a> - Super helpful for sending files across the web without email. Gives you a nice little share link. Tip: Append '+' to them to get a direct link (helpful for embeds!).</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mint-quickview/id533491939?mt=12">Mint.com Menu Bar Helper</a> - Quick view into your financial overview.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> - Powerful automated organization. I'm just starting to get into this, already see the benefit, and am sure I'll blog about some really cool uses soon!</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="http://reederapp.com/mac/">Reeder</a> - Excellent RSS Reader that syncs with Google Reader.</li>
