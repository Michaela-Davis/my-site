I've left Missoula, Montana, USA for Mysore, Karnataka, India. Leaving my wonderful Ann was harder than I thought. Leaving my beloved Montana and all the loved ones in it was saddening also. Nothing like leaving to make you realize what you have. I appreciated it all before, but that appreciation has deepened.</p>

<p>After landing in Minneapolis, I promptly found my next gate, confirmed that my bag would indeed be transfered over with no work from me and then went to find a restaurant to soak in one of those last good American meals I was sure I would grow to miss. Then, pulling a classic Evan, I skated in with about 10 minutes before departure expecting a short to non-existent line, only to find out that I was right: the line was non-existent. But then so was my chance of getting on the flight. To his drop-jawed customer the desk clerk explained that I had to be there at a minimum of 15 minutes before departure. I know, I know: I should know this. And I did, but I just had a flash moment of ineptitude (I mainly blame it on the monster headache that had been building over the day that wouldn't stop tormenting me for another 7 hours). Others will tell you I'm always late, and they are right. Anyway...</p>
<p>After we arranged for me to be on the same flight the next day, he mentions to me that if I call this number (which I don't have anymore, but wanted to share with you) and ask for a "distressed rate", I could get a significant discount on accommodations for the night. They had a shuttle service that would be there at the top of every hour, after catching it I went to my hotel and crashed in frustration and pain (from my <em>massive</em> headache). I awoke to a realization that if I didn't get out and do something, I would not sleep through the night. Taking a previous suggestion, I decided to head to the Mall of America. May as well, huh? Again, the shuttle service of the <a href="http://lq.com">LaQuinta Inn and Suites</a> proved to be friendly and helpful.</p>

</a><p>Yep, it's a big mall. A big mall with a frickin' theme park in the middle. I was underwhelmed by it all. I perused, I walked, I stopped at the LEGO store (which was the coolest part of it all), and then I left. Then back to the hotel for a little internet catchup, a pizza, and then to bed.</p>
<p>You better believe that I made my flight the next day. I was feeling <em>much</em> better too, so I was glad I didn't go on with my travels when I had such a vicious headache that refused to go away. Catching good conversation with so many people on the way was very nice as I love hearing other people perspective of just about anything. Here are some pictures I took during my flight:</p>

<p>Then I was in Newark, NJ for a small time before my flight to India. One of my last American experiences: an Indian Pale Ale. Ha!</p>
<p>Then a 13 1/2 hour flight with an hour delay that left at 9:40pm Eastern time and landed 8:20pm Indian time the next day. We left during night, flew through a very short day (since our arced flight path lead us through the Artic Circle), and then into the night again. Weird. I was surprisingly awake and alert when I landed. Also, contrary to my belief, my bag was not lost.</p>
