Ben, myself, and 5 other yogis and yoginis spent the day at the Namdroling Monastery in the [Bylakupee](http://wikitravel.org/en/Bylakupee) area (an area of 20 villages). This is the biggest Tibetan settlement outside of Tibet. Amazing, powerful buildings depicting thousands of tales on the inner walls. Incredible buddhas, the softest grass I've ever felt (seriously), and a footbag session where I sent a micro-monk away with a free [Freedom Footbag](http://freedomfootbags.com). My friend, Anna, was taking pictures of a classroom inside and they basically ended up swarming her in excitement to see themselves on her camera. I've never seen anything like that. Simply incredible.
