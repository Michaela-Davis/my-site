  description: "Life Goal:Check. After hiking to the amazing spiritual pilgrimage
    spot of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surkanda_Devi\">Surkanda Devi</a>,
    we were blessed with clear blue sky showing us a massive Himalayan Range that
    was utterly breathtaking. Seeing these mountains was the 2nd most important thing
    to do in my trip to India, after studying yoga of course. Below is a stitched
    together shot of 9 photos of the whole range (that I could see). I highly recommend
    clicking on it and then clicking on the zoom button to get a real look at it all.
    Enjoy!\r\n<a href=\"http://www.evanlovely.com/photography/seeing-the-himalayan-range/attachment/himalaya-range-panorama/\"
