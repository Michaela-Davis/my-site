Life Goal:Check. After hiking to the amazing spiritual pilgrimage spot of [Surkanda Devi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surkanda_Devi), we were blessed with clear blue sky showing us a massive Himalayan Range that was utterly breathtaking. Seeing these mountains was the 2nd most important thing to do in my trip to India, after studying yoga of course. Below is a stitched together shot of 9 photos of the whole range (that I could see). I highly recommend clicking on it and then clicking on the zoom button to get a real look at it all. Enjoy!

A small portion of The Himalaya Mountain Range, viewed from Surkanda Devi outside Rishikesh, India. Chine lays on the other side. All the photos I took this day can be [found here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/footfun/sets/72157611817725566). Thanks for checking it all out and have a good day!
