I find the online world emulates the real world in so many funny ways. What we humans see in our world is often re-created by us in the online world.<!--more--> We've taken the resume and turned it into LinkedIn, we've taken the classifieds and turned them into <a href="http://craigslist.com">Craigslist</a>, we've taken poker games and turned them into <a href="http://de.partypoker.com/">online poker games</a>, we've taken pinboards of cool stuff and turned it into <a href="http://pinterest.com">Pinterest</a>, &amp; photo books into <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>. Obviously newspapers have their online sites, movie rentals are moved towards Netflix, funniest homes videos are on YouTube, and even journals are now blogs.

I wonder if the reverse will ever happen. If the communities and concepts that get created in the ever changing online world will get recreated in the real world. We've seen TV news start to display Twitter comments on screen (although I wonder if that's them attempting to stay relevant and seem like they are aware of the newest trends and fads of the Internet generation) and also they run YouTube videos as "user submitted videos". I'm falling short at being able to think of anything that is truly unique to the Internet and not just an extension of the real world that could potentially get re-created in the real world. Have any ideas?
