I've kicked off my note about [International Travel Tips](/notes/international-travel-tips/) with a breakdown of The Four Traveler's Skills. I heard someone offhandedly mention these recently, but couldn't find any online mention of them; so I expanded upon them with my own thoughts as a frequent international traveler.  The note will also serve as a base for other travel tips to be expanded upon later. Hope you enjoy!
