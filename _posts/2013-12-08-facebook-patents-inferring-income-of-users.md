> Among the patents granted to Facebook this week by the USPTO is one for [Inferring Household Income for Users of a Social Networking System](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=8,600,797). 'For example,' Facebook explains, 'an assumption might be made about a user that reads CNN.com and nytimes.com every day that the user is in a higher income bracket than another user that only reads TMZ.com and PerezHilton.com on the theory that a user who reads newspapers might be assumed to make more money than a user who only reads celebrity gossip blogs.' Advertisements such as those for travel packages, cars, and home mortgages, Facebook adds, 'are targeted to users based on income bracket,' which might also be inferred by 'gathering and analyzing different types of information about a user's geographic location.' Hey, [what could go wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining)?
