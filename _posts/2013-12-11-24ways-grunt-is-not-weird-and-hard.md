> Front-end developers are often told to do certain things:

- Work in as small chunks of CSS and JavaScript as makes sense to you, then concatenate them together for the production website.
- Compress your CSS and minify your JavaScript to make their file sizes as small as possible for your production website.

- Use Sass for CSS authoring because of all the useful abstraction it allows.
