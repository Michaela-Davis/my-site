<p><strong>Hi!</strong> I am an Ashtanga Yoga teacher in Portland, OR; though I'm not currently teaching. If you're interested in Ashtanga in Portland, I'd highly recommend the weekly Sunday 5pm class at <a href="http://yogaonyamhill.com" title="Yoga on Yamhill">Yoga on Yamill</a> taught by Nick Landes, my awesome former teacher's assistant. </p>

<p>I've been a yoga student since Feb 2000, and I started studying Ashtanga under Katie Heath in Missoula, MT Sept 2003 and have been avid about it every since. I've written about <a href="/content/blog/yoga/my-path-yoga">my personal start with my yoga</a> if you're interested in all the details.</p>
<p>What I'd like to do with this page is provide some reference for my students and anybody interested in details about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashtanga_Vinyasa_Yoga">Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga</a> as taught by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Pattabhi_Jois">K. Pattabhi Jois</a> in Mysore, India. I plan on starting out with some basic links to a few resources.</p>
