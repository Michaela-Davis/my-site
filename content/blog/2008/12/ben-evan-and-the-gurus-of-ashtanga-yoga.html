<p class="small"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/footfun/3094181825/">Ben, Evan, and the Gurus of Ashtanga Yoga</a></p>
<p>During our trip to the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute in Mysore, India we were privileged, honored, and humbled to momentarily meet Sri K. Pattabhi Joi (affectionately called Guruji), the master who started the style of yoga we practice, Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga. His grandson, Sharath, is now the main teacher, and a master of the first 5-7 series (with the primary series being the 1st). Saraswathi, his mother and Guruji's daughter, assists Sharath at the Shala.
This was the highlight of a lifetime and undescribedly affected Ben and I deeply. TRULY an incredible privilege.</p>
