<p>WOW. No, really. WOW. Driving in Delhi is <strong>nuts</strong>. People cruz through all the obstacles in their way, swerving out of the way of others at the last moment. During our travel down a 2 lane road, there was 3 vehicles (big trucks included) using the road. At one point I even saw a 4th car trying to pass others off the road. Everybody is honking, not in anger or frustration, but in letting others know they are there. Or more accurately, that they are about to steal their spot. Towards the end of my cab ride to my hotel, the guy even turned <strong>up a one-way</strong>, got in the far right lane, switched his emergency flashers on, and then proceeded to honk at people as they approached us head on. HA! That was something else.</p>
