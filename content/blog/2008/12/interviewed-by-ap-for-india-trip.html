<p>So I got an email sent through the contact form of this site by an Associated Press reporter doing a story about Americans traveling to India and how the recent Mumbai attacks affected their plans. After a call back and a quick email she said she would shoot me an email with a link to the story. And she did. Already. That was about a 6 hour turnaround from interview to story, although she probably had already gotten most of the story done. But still, I was impressed.</p>
<p>Here's my glorious part:</p>
