<p style="clear: both;">I have a few friends who are transcending up to the utopian world of iPhone owners, ready to leave behind the frustrating user interfaces of cell phones of old and ready to never be bored in a line again. So, of course, they'd like to know what to put on there. I figured if I was going to type it all out once, I may as well put it up here so it can get reused. All links below will open iTunes.</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><a title="Evernote on iTunes" href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=281796108&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">Evernote</a> - Screw the default Notes app. I know it syncs now, but the features of <a title="Evernote" href="http://evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> make it a solid notch above. Tags, multiple notebooks, audio clips, location tagged notes, <a title="Optical character recognition - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a>, and I love having a separate application on my desktop. Make sure to install it along with the Web Clipper for your browser for the full effect. Free.</p>
