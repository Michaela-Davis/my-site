I clocked myself using my iPhone's GPS &amp; a 99 cent app going down Paradise at Montana Snowbowl outside Missoula. Check out the screenshot's Max Speed. So interesting to put an objective figure to a subjective feeling. I'd like to hit 55, but I don't really feel the need to go much faster than that. Something about going highway speed...
