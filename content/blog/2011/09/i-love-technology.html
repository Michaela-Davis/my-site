I love technology. Quite possibly the greatest tool humanity's created, it allows me to learn about my environment as I walk through it, creates the situation where work is something I do not someplace I go, allowed me to teach myself a profession I didn't graduate college for, lets me see my mothers face smile a half-world away, helps me not waste a library's worth of paper, and disperses ignorance through collective wisdom. It's all in how you use it. Use it well.
