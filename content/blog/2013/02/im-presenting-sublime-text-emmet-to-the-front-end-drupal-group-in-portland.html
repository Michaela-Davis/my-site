<p>This Thursday at the Portland Front End Drupal meet up, I'll be presenting on how to use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> &amp; <a href="http://docs.emmet.io/">Emmet</a> to greatly speed up the workflow of front end web development. Zen Coding was rebranded as Emmet recently and has some good momentum in its development. I personally have used it in my CSS &amp; HTML creation workflow for about 3 years and can't imagine not having it. I've been using Sublime Text for about a year and a half and it too is something I couldn't develop without. I'll go over fundamentals of that app and bring up some of my favorite packages I use to extend the app's functionality. It should be an awesome time! The Drupal Front End Meet up happens this Thursday the 21st of February, 2013 (and every third Thursday) at the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/mvdF">Funny Monkey offices on 2410 East Burnside</a> at 6pm.</p>
