> Ditch sidebar and browse your files in a normal tab with keyboard, like a pro!

This works really nice! It cracks open directories and files in a Sublime Text tab just like other text files, so you can use all of the navigation methods and tools you're used to, like multiple cursors and search & replace to rename files!
