I'm incredibly pleased to come onboard with one of the best [Drupal][drupal] agencies, [Phase2](http://www.phase2technology.com)! I'm looking forward to pushing my front end web development and responsive web design skills to another level, and I can't really think of a better spot than there. Being a freelance contractor allows a wonderfully flexible situation to work on the skills you want to grow, but once you know what you want to do, you want to do it with the best around. I'm excited to learn and share from such a passionate, driven team as Phase 2. Here's to my next phase! ;)
