Well, the [new Review Section](/reviews) is more of a page at the moment as it's simply a list of products that I like a lot. I try and add a bit of commentary where needed. I've started with some basic sorting to break things into Outdoor Gear, Drinks equipment (apparently I'm really into different drinks...), and Tech Gear (though I don't have software recommendations â€“ I keep those [here](/notes/my-awesome-mac-setup)). I'll keeping this one page up to date with the gear I'm loving; hope you get some use out of it!
