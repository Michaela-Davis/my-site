Here's a list of my favorite [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) Workflows (basically plugins). The paid "PowerPack" is needed for all of these. Plenty more can be found in the [Alfred Forum](http://www.alfredforum.com/forum/3-share-your-workflows/) - I suggest filtering the list by "Most Replies" or "Most Viewed".

- [Colors](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/805-colorsâ€”convert-color-formats-access-the-os-x-color-panel/) - Color picker and convert between Hex/HSL/RSG
- [Pinboard](http://github.com/eknkc/alfred-pinboard) - Search your Pinboard bookmarks. 
- [Rdio](http://dferg.us/rdio-workflow-for-alfred-2/) - Live search Rdio. There's one for [Spotify](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1644-spotifious-a-natural-spotify-controller-for-alfred/) too.
- [Search Browser Tabs](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/236-search-safari-and-chrome-tabs-updated-feb-8-2014/) - Live search of all open Chrome/Safari tabs. I'd go insane without this one.
- [Shorten URL](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/935-workflowshorten-url-support-googl-bitly-tcn-jmp-isgd-vgd/) - Take a URL and make it short!
- [TerminalFinder](https://github.com/LeEnno/alfred-terminalfinder) - Bounce current directory between Finder and Terminal/iTerm
- [Send URL](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/538-send-url/) - Sends the current browsers URL to another browser
- [Reminders](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/917-reminders/) - I don't use the Reminders app for task management, but they work great for quick "reminders". Especially useful is the `r this` command which creates a reminder with a link back to what you are on: email or web page are two used frequently by me.
- [StackOverflow Search with Auto-Complete](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1524-stackoverflow-workflow/) - I search for help all the time and usually the info that's formatted the best is here; love the auto completion as well!
