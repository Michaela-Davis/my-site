- [Olympus PEN Lite E-PL5](http://www.olympus.co.uk/site/en/c/cameras/pen_cameras/pen_lite/e_pl5/) (mirrorless camera)
- [Panasonic 20mm f1.7][7792-001] fixed lens
- [Panasonic 14mm f2.5][7792-002] fixed lens
- [Olympus 14-150mm f4-f5.6][7792-003] zoom lens

The sensor on that camera is a half cropped sensor of a 35mm/full frame camera; so my 20mm lens feels like a 40mm lens on a full frame camera.
