# Backpack

- [Osprey Farpoint 70L][0467-003] ~ Has a zip off daypack; my stuff wouldn't nearly fill the whole bag but having the extra space allows easy packing and retrieval of stuff; and would allow room for souvenirs purchased (preferably during the last few days of the trip). Could use bigger water bottle pockets, but otherwise very high quality gear.
