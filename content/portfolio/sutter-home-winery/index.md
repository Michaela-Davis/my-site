I was pulled in to help with the Drupal theming of the Sutter Home site by [The New Group](http://www.thenewgroup.com/work/sutter-home/sutter-home) and taking on the full arrangement of the Book Section of the site; handling all views creation, node display field configuration, features exportation, and CSS styling from provided PhotoShop mockups. Additionally, I handled the tablet and mobile view of all pages; making sure that the pages looked appropriate on each device by using Responsive Web Design techniques. This site went on to win a [Rosey Award in the Responsive Design Category](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/525654587728414673/) as well!

### The Award Description

>Browser compatibility is for beginners. Elegance across 10 different laptops, 8 tablets, and 605 styles of smart phones takes next level developer mojo. Show me your mojo.
