My friend [Ryan](http://twitter.com/rjames86) wanted a closer look at my deployment processes for my Jekyll site, so I put together information about how I use [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts), [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php), Shell Scripts, [rsync](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync), and [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) to deploy this [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Additionally, the note contains some of the other tricks I use. Check out the details over at my [About This Jekyll Site](/notes/about-this-jekyll-site) note! As with my other notes, it'll surely expand in the future. PS Did you know my whole site is viewable on [GitHub](https://github.com/EvanLovely/my-jekyll-site)?
