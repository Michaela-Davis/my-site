I recently found out that the [Sutter Home Winery](http://www.sutterhome.com/) project I worked on with [The New Group](http://www.thenewgroup.com/work/sutter-home/sutter-home) has won an [award for Responsive Web Design](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/525654587728414673/)! I handled the mobile, tablet, and desktop Drupal theming of the book section of that site while working along side other developers from The New Group. Congratulations to the team at The New Group!
