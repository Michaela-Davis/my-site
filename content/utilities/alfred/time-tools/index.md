I got sick of trying to figure out what time it is on the East Coast, so I made this easy [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) Workflow that tells me (and copies it). Works for West Coast time too. [Download it here](/utilities/alfred/time-tools/Time-Tools.alfredworkflow) and then just type `time` after invoking Alfred.
