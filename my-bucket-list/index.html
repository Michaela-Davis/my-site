title: My Bucket List
---

<p>Welcome to my Bucket List. Inspired by <a href="http://www.seanogle.com/bucket-list">Sean Ogle</a>, <a href="http://www.thrillingheroics.com/my-bucket-list-awesome-life-goals">Cody McKibben</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?aq=f&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=my+bucket+list">many others</a>, I've decided to publicly keep a list of things I want to do before I die (or kick the bucket as the lists namesake is inspired by). I hope that the public nature of this inspires me to not let the opportunities pass that I claim to want. It's much easier to make excuses to yourself why you didn't do something that it is to explain to others why you didn't. Anyway, here goes:</p>
