I was pulled in to help with the Drupal theming of the Sutter Home site by taking on the full arrangement of the Book Section of the site; handling all views creation, node display field configuration, features exportation, and CSS styling from provided PhotoShop mockups. Additionally, I handled the tablet and mobile view of all pages; making sure that the pages looked appropriate on each device by using Responsive Web Design techniques.
