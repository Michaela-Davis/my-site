Here is a list of my favorite gear. If it's on this list, I like it; if I find something better I'll take the old one off this list. Also, I'm not hired by them and only recommend them out of my own love of the product – however, I will use an [affiliate link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_link) if easily available.

## Drinks

- [Yerba Maté](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate) - Great, super healthy alternative to coffee. I recommend the [Cruz de Malta Yerba Mate][cruz], a [bombilla](http://ma-tea.com/products/Simple-Curved-Spring-End-Yerba-Mate-Bombilla.html) (metal straw), and a [gourd from Ma-Tea.com](http://ma-tea.com/small-carob-wood-yerba-mate-gourd-with-aluminum-base/). You'll need a thermos for hot water too. [Here's how to prepare the tea in the gourd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr5JjFfbDuA).
- [AeroPress](http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm) - Fabulous way to make excellent coffee easily, quickly, and one cup at a time.
- [HydroFlask](http://www.hydroflask.com/) Water Bottle/Coffee Mug - Stays hot/cold for _very_ long.
- [Guayusa Tea](http://runa.org) - Better green tea. Cousin to Yerba Maté that bills itself as "Clean Energy". Great for drinking all day and not getting jittery like coffee or Yerba Maté.
- [Great Hot Pot](http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-40996-Programmable-1-7-Liter/dp/B0083I7THI/ref=sr_1_40?ie=UTF8&qid=1393268205&sr=8-40&keywords=hot+pot+temperature) for Coffee/Tea - It lets you set specific temps besides just boiling (great for teas and for impatient coffee drinkers), it keeps it at that temp for an hour afterwards (great for hard workers or distracted developers) AND it costs half of what a selectable temperature hot pot normally costs: $42 instead of $80-90. I have one and love it. Additionally, it has an alarm to kick off heating - this coupled with the keep it hot for an hour allows you to walk into your kitchen in an hour window in the a.m. and have perfectly heated water ready to go.

## Outdoor Gear

- [Osprey Hiking Bags](http://www.ospreypacks.com/en/segmentation/backpackinghiking)
- [Icebreaker Merino Wool Clothing](http://www.icebreaker.com/) - Simply the best. Comfortable, warm when cold, cool when hot, and very stink resistant - phenomenal travel clothing. 


## Tech 

- [Olympus PEN Lite E-PL5](http://www.olympus.co.uk/site/en/c/cameras/pen_cameras/pen_lite/e_pl5/) mirrorless camera - Fabulous camera
- [Panasonic 20mm f1.7](http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Aspherical-Pancake-Interchangeable-Cameras/dp/B002IKLJVE) fixed lens - Will elevate your shots incredibly if you're just using the kit lens.


## Misc

- [Nada Chair](http://www.nadachair.com/) - Fabulous back support in a tiny package, you can take this to coffee shops for work. Silly site; excellent product
