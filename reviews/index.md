Here is a list of my favorite gear. If it's on this list, I like it; if I find something better I'll take the old one off this list. As I'm just staring out with this list, at first it'll be a random order; then as I get a good chunk, I'll see the natural categories and separate and organize them. Also, I'm not hired by them and only recommend them out of my own love of the product – however, I will use an [affiliate link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_link) if easily available. 

__I have my [Mac Software Recommendations here](/notes/my-awesome-mac-setup/).__

- [HydroFlask](http://www.hydroflask.com/) Water Bottle/Coffee Mug - Stays hot/cold for very long.
- [Nada Chair](http://www.nadachair.com/) - Fabulous back support in a tiny package, you can take this to coffee shops for work. Silly site; excellent product
- [Osprey Hiking Bags](http://www.ospreypacks.com/en/segmentation/backpackinghiking)
- [AeroPress](http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm) - Fabulous way to make excellent coffee easily, quickly, and one cup at a time.
- [Yerba Maté](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate) - Great, super healthy alternative to coffee.
- [Guayusa Tea](http://runa.org) - Better green tea. Cousin to Yerba Maté that bills itself as "Clean Energy". Great for drinking all day and not getting jittery like coffee or Yerba Maté.
- [Great Hot Pot](http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-40996-Programmable-1-7-Liter/dp/B0083I7THI/ref=sr_1_40?ie=UTF8&qid=1393268205&sr=8-40&keywords=hot+pot+temperature) for Coffee/Tea - It lets you set specific temps besides just boiling (great for teas and for impatient coffee drinkers), it keeps it at that temp for an hour afterwards (great for hard workers or distracted developers) AND it costs half of what a selectable temperature hot pot normally costs: $42 instead of $80-90. I have one and love it. Additionally, it has an alarm to kick off heating - this coupled with the keep it hot for an hour allows you to walk into your kitchen in an hour window in the a.m. and have perfectly heated water ready to go.
- [Olympus PEN Lite E-PL5](http://www.olympus.co.uk/site/en/c/cameras/pen_cameras/pen_lite/e_pl5/) mirrorless camera - Fabulous camera
- [Panasonic 20mm f1.7](http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Aspherical-Pancake-Interchangeable-Cameras/dp/B002IKLJVE) fixed lens - Will elevate your shots incredibly if you're just using the kit lens.
