Wow! One of my photos I took of a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/footfun/6349704944/">sunset in Koh Lipe, Thailand</a> was surprisingly featured in <a href="http://www.stuckonearthapp.com/">Stuck on Earth</a>, an iPad photo app made by my photography hero <a href="http://twitter.com/TreyRatcliff">@TreyRatcliff</a>! I was browsing the the featured photos section, and came across a photo where I thought “Wow, I took a shot just like that!”, and then my eyes drifted down to the photographers name to elatedly discover that is was me! I’m honored and amazed :)
